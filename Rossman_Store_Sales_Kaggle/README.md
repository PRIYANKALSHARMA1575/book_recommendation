Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales

Description:
Developed a predictive model to forecast sales for Rossmann stores using historical data and multiple influencing factors. The project focused on leveraging machine learning techniques to provide accurate sales predictions, which can assist in optimizing inventory management and strategic decision-making.

Key Highlights:

Feature Engineering: Incorporated features such as store location, number of stores, historical sales data, and special events or promotions to enhance model accuracy.
Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal effects in the sales data.
Handling Multiple Factors: Accounted for various factors influencing store performance, including:
Days of high customer traffic.
Franchise-specific variations.
External factors like holidays or economic trends.
Model Development: Built and evaluated machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting techniques (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) for accurate predictions.
Outcome: Achieved high prediction accuracy and provided actionable insights into factors driving store sales, enabling better planning and resource allocation.
Tech Stack: Python (Jupyter Notebook) , Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

This project showcases my ability to work with complex datasets and deliver practical solutions for real-world business challenges.
